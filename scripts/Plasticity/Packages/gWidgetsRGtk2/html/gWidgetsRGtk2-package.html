<h2>
Toolkit implementation of gWidgets for RGtk2
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Port of gWidgets API to RGtk2
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package allows the gWidgets API to use the RGtk2 package allowing
the use of the GTK libraries within R. The documentation for
the functions in this package are contained in the gWidgets package.
</p>
<p>As gWidgets is meant to be multi-toolkit, this file documents
differences from the API, as defined by the man pages of the
<span class="pkg">gWidgets</span> package.
</p>
<p><b>Containers:</b><br />
</p>
<p>If using a <code>ggraphics</code> device, one should call <code>gwindow</code>
with the argument <code>visible=FALSE</code> then after the device is
added call the <code>visible&lt;-</code> method to show the window.
</p>
<p>To access the underlying gtk container from a <code>gframe</code> object
one uses <code>getToolkitWidget(obj)$getParent()</code> <br />
</p>
<p>The gnotebook changed handler has component <code>pageno</code> to
indicate the newly selected page number, as the <code>svalue</code> method
returns the page before the change.<br />
</p>
<p><b>Widgets:</b><br />
</p>
<p>The <code>gbutton</code> constructor can not be called before
<span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> is loaded. This means that an initial call like
<code>gbutton("label", cont=gwindow())</code> won't work. Instead, either
load directly <span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> (not just <span class="pkg">gWidgets</span>) or
create another widget, like a top-level window. Something similar is the case
for the <code>gdfedit</code> widget.
<br />
</p>
<p>The <code>gradio</code> widget can now have its items shortened or lengthened via <code>[&lt;-</code>.<br />
</p>
<p>For the data frame viewer <code>gtable</code> when no filtering is
requested &ndash; the default &ndash; the column headers can be clicked to sort
the values. Setting the index to 0 will clear the selection.
</p>
<p>In the data frame editor <code>gdf</code> the <code>subset</code> option only
works if the column names have not been changed. One can suppress
the creation of keyboard navigation and the right click popup on the
column headers. The hiddern argument <code>diy</code> (for do it yourself)
if left empty will place in both. A value of <code>"suppress.key"</code>
or <code>"suppress.popup"</code> (or both) will suppress the respective
handler.  <br />
</p>
<p>The <code>gaction</code> constructor produces action objects. The
<code>enabled&lt;-</code> method can be used to set their sensitivity. The
objects can be used with <code>gbutton</code> through the <code>action</code>
argument, and in the lists defining menubars and toolbars. The
<code>key.accel</code> argument (for assigning a keyboard accelerator) of the constructor is ignored for now. The
<code>tooltip</code> is OS sensitive, as it depends on the event loop
implementation. <br />
</p>
<p>The <code>gtoolbar</code> list can have components that are a) lists with
a handler componented, b) lists with a separator component, c)
gaction instances d) gWidgets, in which case the widget appears in
the toolbar. The latter is not portable to other gWidgets
implementations.<br />
</p>
<p>The <code>gvarbrowser</code> constructor depends on a variable
<code>knownTypes</code>. A default is provided in the package, but this can
be overridden by a) providing a hidden argument <code>knownTypes</code> to
the constructor or b) setting an option <code>knownTypes</code>. In each
case this is a named list whose components are character vectors
listing classes of a similar nature. For example, the default value
for <code>knownTypes</code> included <code>"data sets"=
  c("numeric","logical","factor","character","integer",
  "data.frame","matrix","list", "table","xtabs",
  "nfnGroupedData","nffGroupedData","nmGroupedData",
  "POSIXct","POSIXlt","POSIXt" )</code>.  <br />
</p>
<p>The function used to map a class to an icon is by default
<code>getStockIconFromClass</code>. This can be changed by assigning a
function to the option <code>gWidgetsStockIconFromClass</code>. This function should take a class and return a stock icon name. (The class passed is the first value only.) 
</p>
<p>The <code>gfile</code> constructor has the argument <code>multiple</code>, which if
TRUE will allow for multiple selections of files. This feature
should be merged into the gWidgets API, but for now is passed in via
<code>...</code>.
<br />
</p>
<p>The <code>ggraphics</code> constructor provides a means to embed a graphics
window inside a GUI. A right mouse popup allows one to copy the
graphic to the clipboard or save it to a file. The different file
types are limited by the function <code>gdkPixbufSave</code> whose manual page states
that jpg, png, ico and bmp are permissable.
</p>
<p>A few quirks exist.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Drawing a graphic too soon may result in a message about
<code>plot.margins too small</code>. This comes from trying to draw the
first graphic before the window is fully realized.
<br />
</p>
<p>One workaround is to initially set the window not visible then when the GUI is done, make the window visible. That is, try: <code>w &lt;- gwindow(visible=FALSE); ggraphics(cont=w); visible(w) &lt;- TRUE; hist(rnorm(100))</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When there are multiple
devices, the standard means of setting a device via <code>dev.set</code>
are supplemented by mouse handlers. Clicking in the graphics window
sets the window as the current device.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The handler for <code>addHandlerClicked</code> responds to a  mouse
click. The components <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> give the coordinates in
&quot;usr&quot; coordinates.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The handler for <code>addHandlerChanged</code> responds to the
&quot;rubber-banding&quot; effect that comes from trying to trace out a
rectangle in the graphic window. The components <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
give the coordinates in &quot;usr&quot; coordinates. (These each have two
values.) The functions <code>grconvertX</code> and <code>grconvertY</code> can
convert to other coordinate systems for you. See the <code>ggraphics</code>
help page for an example of how
this can be used to update a data frame.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The <code>gbasicdialog</code> constructor can be used both ways. The hidden
argument <code>buttons</code> can take values <code>ok</code>, <code>yes</code>,
<code>cancel</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>no</code>, with a default of <code>c("ok","cancel")</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b><br />
</p>
<p>The <code>font</code> method is not implemented. 
<br />
</p>
<p>For widgets which allow markup (<code>gframe</code>, <code>glabel</code>) PANGO
markup is used. This is not HTML, but is similar to basic HTML.<br />
</p>
<p><b>gWidgetsRGtk2 and the RGtk2 package:</b><br />	
</p>
<p>The <span class="pkg">RGtk2</span> package is imported only so its namespace, which is
large, is not loaded by default. To access its functions, load the
package. <br />
</p>
<p>The <span class="pkg">RGtk2</span> package and <span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> can be used together
in the following ways. First, an <span class="pkg">RGtk2</span> object can be added to
a <span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> through the <code>add</code> method of the
container. This works for most objects. If you find one that doesn't
work, simply place it inside a <code>gtkHBox</code> container, then add
that container. Second, a <span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> object can be added to
to a <span class="pkg">RGtk2</span> container by adding the return value of the
<code>getToolkitWidget</code> method of the object. Again, this should
work, but if not, the <span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> can be added to a
<code>ggroup</code> container first. In either case, the
<span class="pkg">gWidgetsRGtk2</span> object should not be previsously attached to a container, so
in particular the constructor should be called with its
<code>container</code> argument as <code>NULL</code> (the default).
