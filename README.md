# data-analysis_template

 This repository is a template of a data analysis project repository, which can be used to create a new data anlysis project repository.
 
 To use the template to make a new data analysis project repository, you just need to click on the Use this template button from the GitHub page of the repository.
 This will create a new project repository in your GitHub profile, with a set of folders and subfolders, an R project file, an empty R master script (Analysis.R), some README 
 files, a .gitignore file, and two reproducible sciences files.
 Once you have created the new repository with the template, you can re-name the R project file to match the name you have selected for the repository.
